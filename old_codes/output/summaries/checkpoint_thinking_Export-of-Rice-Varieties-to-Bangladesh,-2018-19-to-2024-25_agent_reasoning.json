  "thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let me go through the steps again to make sure everything was done correctly. The user provided a dataset with 23 columns and some null values in the later years. First, I called analyze_profile(), which identified the potential key columns and the high null percentages. Then, verify_calculations() confirmed the data quality metrics. Finally, create_dataset_summary() was used with the composite key of HS Code and Description, and the notes highlighted the data issues and suggestions for further analysis. The tool response indicated success, so the job is done.\n</think>\n\nThe dataset summary has been successfully created and validated. Key outcomes:\n\n1. **Primary Key**: Composite key `[\"HS Code\", \"Description\"]` identified as uniquely identifying records\n2. **Data Quality**: \n   - 2018-2021 data has 0-12.5% nulls\n   - 2023-24 data has critical 62.5% nulls across all fields\n3. **Recommendations**:\n   - Focus analysis on 2018-2021 period\n   - Investigate missing data in 2023-24\n   - Compare INR/USD valuation trends\n\nThe enhanced metadata is now available for Stage 2 analysis."
