        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is trying to get visualizations for their custom task TSK-3849, but the response is empty. They've gone through several steps: creating the task, checking the pipeline status, and trying to get execution results, which were not found. Now, when they ask for visualizations, there's nothing there.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why the visualizations aren't showing up. The task was created, but maybe it wasn't executed properly. The pipeline status showed that other tasks like PLAN-TSK-1155 have completed all stages, but TSK-3849 isn't listed. That suggests that the custom task might not have been processed through the pipeline stages correctly.\n\nThe user tried to run the pipeline with TSK-3849, but the tool 'run_pipeline' isn't valid. The correct approach is to use 'get_execution_results' or 'get_visualizations' with the task ID. However, since the execution results are empty, it's possible that the task hasn't been executed yet or there was an error during execution.\n\nLooking back, when the user created the task, they specified the date_column as \"Year\", but the dataset might not have a \"Year\" column. The original dataset has columns like \"Area-2020-21\", which are years in the column names, not a separate Year column. This mismatch could be causing the task to fail during execution, leading to no results or visualizations.\n\nSo, the root issue is likely the missing or incorrect date_column. The task expects a \"Year\" column for temporal analysis, but the dataset doesn't have it. The user needs to adjust the task parameters to use the correct column or reshape the data to include a Year column. Without this, the pipeline can't generate results or visualizations.\n\nThe next step is to inform the user about this discrepancy and suggest modifying the task to use the correct date column or reformatting the data. They might need to create a new task with the proper parameters or preprocess the data to include a Year column before proceeding.\n</think>\n\nThe visualization system cannot find results for TSK-3849 because the task hasn't been successfully executed yet. Based on the pipeline status and error patterns, here's what's happening:\n\n1. **Task Configuration Issue**: Your custom task uses `date_column=\"Year\"` but the dataset \"All-India-Estimates...\" doesn't contain a \"Year\" column - it has area columns like \"Area-2020-21\" instead.\n\n2. **Execution Gap**: While the task was created (TSK-3849), it hasn't been processed through the pipeline stages shown in the status report (which only show PLAN-TSK-001 and PLAN-TSK-1155).\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. Use `evaluate_user_query` to refine the task parameters\n2. Consider using the \"Production\" column from TSK-1155 which already has working pipeline execution\n3. If you want to keep your area-focused approach, we'll need to:\n   - Either reshape the data to extract years from column names\n   - Or use a different dataset with proper temporal structure\n\nWould you like to try one of these approaches or explore an alternative solution?",
