Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a proposal based on the dataset summaries provided. First, I need to look at the three datasets mentioned: the rice exports to Bangladesh, the All-India food grains estimates, and the crop-wise area profile.

The main goal is to create a predictive task. The user emphasized using INR over USD and ensuring all columns have at least 65% non-NaN data. Let me check the completeness of each dataset.

For the rice exports dataset, the 2018-2021 data has 0-12.5% nulls, which is good. But 2023-24 has 62.5% nulls, so maybe exclude those years. The food grains dataset has 18.3% missing in 2020-21 and 2021-22, but later years are complete. The area profile has missing data in earlier years too, but recent years are better.

The candidate primary keys in the rice exports are HS Code and Description. The food grains and area profile use Crop and Season. To join these datasets, maybe use Crop and Season as the key. But the rice exports might not have a direct link to Crop, unless "Description" in the rice dataset corresponds to specific crops like Rice varieties. However, the food grains dataset includes Rice as a crop. So perhaps there's a way to link them, but it's a bit indirect. Maybe the join plan is to use Crop and Season from the food grains and area datasets, and for the rice exports, use the Description to map to Rice in the other datasets. But the rice exports are specific to Bangladesh, so maybe the join isn't straightforward. Alternatively, focus on the food grains and area datasets which share Crop and Season as keys.

The target variable could be the Production in INR from the food grains dataset, predicting future production based on area and yield trends. The features could include area, yield, and maybe historical production data. The rice exports data might not be directly useful here due to the focus on Bangladesh and the missing data in later years. So, the required files would be the All-India Estimates and the Crop-wise Area files. The join plan would use Crop and Season as the primary key. Excluded columns would be the USD values and the problematic years with high nulls. The validation plan would involve time-series cross-validation, checking for data completeness, and ensuring the models generalize well. The expected outputs would be predictive models, trend plots, and metrics like RMSE.
