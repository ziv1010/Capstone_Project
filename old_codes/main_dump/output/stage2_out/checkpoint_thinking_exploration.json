The export data has specific rice types in the 'Description' column, but the production data just has 'Rice' as the crop. So, I need to map all those specific rice types to the general 'Rice' category in the production data.\n\nFirst, I'll filter the export data to the overlapping years, which are 2020-21 to 2024-25. Then, I'll create a new column in the export data that sets the crop to 'Rice' regardless of the description. That way, when I merge on 'Year' and 'Crop', it should align with the production data.\n\nWait, but the production data also has a 'Season' column. The export data doesn't have a season, so maybe I need to handle that. Hmm, the production data's 'Season' might not be directly relevant here, but since it's part of the production data's key, I might need to consider it. However, the export data doesn't have season information, so perhaps I can ignore it or set it to a default value like 'Total' if that's an option in the production data.\n\nLooking back at the production data, the 'Season' column includes 'Kharif', 'Rabi', 'Summer', and 'Total'. Since the export data doesn't specify a season, maybe the 'Total' season in the production data is the one that aggregates all seasons, making it suitable for joining. So, I should filter the production data to 'Total' season to get the overall rice production without seasonal breakdown.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Filter the export data to years 2020-21 to 2024-25.\n2. Add a 'Crop' column to the export data with value 'Rice'.\n3. Filter the production data to 'Rice' crop and 'Total' season.\n4. Merge the filtered export data with the filtered production data on 'Year' and 'Crop'.\n\nAfter merging, the dataset should have features from both datasets, allowing for predictive modeling. The target variable could be the export quantity or value in INR. Since the user prefers INR over USD, I'll use the INR columns for the target.\n\nI need to make sure that the 'Year' columns in both datasets are in the same format. The export data's 'Year' after reshaping is '2020-21', etc., which matches the production data's 'Year' column.\n\nAlso, check for any missing values in the merged dataset. The production data has no nulls in the relevant years, but the export data might have some, especially in 2023-24 and 2024-25. Need to handle those, maybe by dropping rows with too many missing values or imputing them.\n\nOnce the data is merged and cleaned, split it into training and testing sets, then apply a regression model to predict export values based on production metrics like area, production, and yield.\n</think>\n\n"
