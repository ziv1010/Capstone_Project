        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me wrap this up. The user wanted an area-wise prediction for rice over the next three years. We created a custom task and ran the pipeline, which completed successfully. The model has a high R-squared value, which is good, but the MAPE is around 16%, meaning there's some error. The visualizations show the actual vs predicted values and residuals. Since there are only three samples, the predictions might not be very reliable. The user should probably look at the plots to see the trends, but keep in mind the limitations due to the small sample size. Let me present the final answer with the results and visualizations.\n</think>\n\nHere are your rice area predictions for the next 3 years:\n\n**Model Performance:**\n- R-squared: 98.3% (strong fit)\n- MAPE: 16.34% (moderate error)\n- Residuals plot shows consistent underestimation\n\n**Visualizations Available:**\n1. `actual_vs_predicted.png` - Shows model predictions vs real values\n2. `residuals_histogram.png` - Distribution of prediction errors\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Examine the actual vs predicted plot for regional patterns\n2. Check residuals histogram to understand error distribution\n3. Consider collecting more historical data to improve accuracy (currently only 3 samples used for evaluation)\n\nWould you like me to share the specific predicted values or help interpret the visualizations?",
