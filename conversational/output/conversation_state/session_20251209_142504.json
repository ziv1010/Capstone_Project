        "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user tried to run task tsk-002 but got an error because the run_pipeline function isn't available in the current toolset. Let me check the available functions again. The tools listed include get_available_data, get_summaries, get_task_proposals, check_pipeline_status, evaluate_user_query, create_custom_task_from_query, get_execution_results, and get_visualizations. There's no run_pipeline function here.\n\nHmm, the user might have thought that running a task is possible through a direct function call, but according to the provided tools, there's no such function. The correct approach would be to guide the user through the available steps. Maybe the user needs to first check the pipeline status to see which stages are completed or get execution results if the task has been run before. Alternatively, if the task hasn't been created yet, they might need to create a custom task using create_custom_task_from_query. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"run tsk-002\", which suggests they want to execute a specific task. Since the run_pipeline function isn't available, perhaps the next best step is to check the pipeline status to see if the task is ready to run or if there are any pending stages. The check_pipeline_status function can provide information on the current state of the pipeline, which might help in understanding why the task can't be executed directly. \n\nAlternatively, if the task hasn't been proposed yet, the user might need to generate task proposals using get_task_proposals to see if tsk-002 exists. If it does, they can then proceed to run it through the appropriate stages. But since the user is getting an error about the function not existing, the immediate step is to inform them that running the pipeline isn't directly possible with the current tools and suggest alternative actions like checking the status or execution results.\n</think>\n\nIt looks like I tried to use an invalid command. Let me clarify what we can do with the available tools. Since we can't directly run the pipeline, here are your options:\n\n1. **Check pipeline status**: See which stages have been completed\n2. **Get execution results**: View results if this task has been run before\n3. **Get visualizations**: See any plots generated for this task\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Check the current pipeline status for tsk-002?\n- Show execution results for tsk-002?\n- Display visualizations for tsk-002?\n\n<tools>\n{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"check_pipeline_status\", \"description\": \"Check the current status of the pipeline.\", \"parameters\": {\"properties\": {}, \"type\": \"object\"}}}\n{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"get_execution_results\", \"description\": \"Get results from executed tasks.\", \"parameters\": {\"properties\": {\"plan_id\": {\"default\": null, \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"type\": \"object\"}}}\n{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"get_visualizations\", \"description\": \"Get visualization reports and plot locations.\", \"parameters\": {\"properties\": {\"plan_id\": {\"default\": null, \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"type\": \"object\"}}}\n</tools>",
