        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me see. The user asked for forecasts on rice export quantity for the next three years from 2025-2027. The system evaluated the query and found the best dataset to be \"Wholesale-Mandi_Price-from-2012-to-2025 in(RS_qntls) (1).csv\". But wait, that dataset seems to be about mandi prices (market prices) rather than export quantities. The second dataset mentioned in the evaluation, \"Export-of-Rice-Varieties-to-Bangladesh,-2018-19-to-2024-25.csv\", actually has export quantities but was ranked lower. The user's query specifically mentions \"export quantity\", so maybe the system made a mistake in selecting the dataset.\n\nThe target column chosen was \"February-2025\", which is a specific month in 2025. But the user wants annual forecasts from 2025 to 2027. The dataset's columns are monthly, so aggregating them into annual data might be necessary. However, the system didn't mention that. Also, the date column was set to None, which might be an issue because the model needs temporal information to make forecasts. \n\nThe forecast configuration is set for 3 years, but since the data ends in 2025, predicting three years ahead would go up to 2028. The user asked for 2025-2027, which is three years starting from 2025. The system's setup seems to align with that, but the dataset's time range might not be sufficient for accurate long-term forecasting. \n\nI should check if the user is okay with using the selected dataset or if they want to switch to the one with actual export quantities. Also, clarify if the target column should be an annual aggregate instead of a monthly value. Additionally, confirm if the date column needs to be specified properly for the model to understand the time series structure.\n</think>\n\nLet me confirm the task configuration before proceeding:\n\n**Task Summary**\n- **Dataset**: Wholesale-Mandi_Price-from-2012-to-2025 in(RS_qntls) (1).csv\n- **Target**: February-2025 (monthly price data)\n- **Forecast Horizon**: 3 years (will predict 36 months ahead)\n- **Date Column**: Not specified (will use index-based forecasting)\n\nWould you like to:\n1. ✅ Accept this configuration and run the task\n2. 🔄 Adjust the dataset/target column (e.g., use export quantity data instead)\n3. ⚙️ Modify forecast parameters (e.g., change to annual forecasts)\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!",
