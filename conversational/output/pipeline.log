Okay, let's start by listing all the available dataset summaries. I need to call the list_dataset_summaries function first. That will give me an overview of what datasets are present. Once I have that list, I can read each summary to understand their columns and semantics.

After that, I have to call explore_data_relationships without any arguments to find potential joins between datasets. This step is crucial for creating multi-dataset tasks. The user emphasized that at least two tasks ...

Okay, let's start by listing all the available datasets. The user provided a list of summaries, so I need to check each one to see what data they contain. The main datasets are related to crop production, exports, mandi prices, and soil data. 

First, I'll call the explore_data_relationships function without any arguments to find potential joins between these datasets. That should help identify common columns that can be used to combine datasets for multi-dataset tasks.
