Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a second proposal that's different from the first one, which was about predicting food grain production using area and yield data. So I need to find another angle.

Looking at the dataset summaries, there's the export data to Bangladesh for rice varieties. The first proposal used the All-India estimates, so maybe this export data is a good candidate. The problem statement needs to mention data completeness. The export dataset has some columns with high null fractions, especially in 2023-24, but the notes say that 2018-2021 have better completeness. Let me check the columns. The 2018-2021 columns have 0-12.5% nulls, which is under 35%, so 65% non-null. The others like 2022-23 have up to 25%, which is still okay. So all required columns meet the 65% threshold.

The target could be predicting the value in INR for future years. The features would be the historical quantities and values. The join plan might not be necessary here since it's a single dataset. Excluded columns would be the USD values as per the user's preference for INR. Handling missingness could involve imputation or dropping later years with more nulls. The validation plan would split the data into train and test sets based on time. Quality checks would ensure data completeness and check for trends. Expected outputs include time series plots and model metrics. That should cover it.
