Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a proposal based on the dataset summaries and tool outputs. First, I need to look at the data files mentioned. There's the export data for rice varieties to Bangladesh, the production estimates, and the crop-wise area data.

The main goal here is to create a predictive task. The export data has years from 2018-19 to 2024-25, but the production data starts from 2020-21. The user mentioned preferring INR over USD, so I should focus on the INR columns. Also, all columns need to have at least 65% non-NaN data. Checking the summaries, the export data for 2020-21 onwards has no nulls, which meets the requirement. The production data also has no nulls from 2020-21 onwards.

The problem statement should mention predicting future export values based on production data. The target would be the export value in INR. The features would include production metrics like area, production quantity, and yield. The join plan would link the export data with production data on the year and crop, using 'Rice' as the crop type. Excluded columns would be the USD values and any redundant columns like HS Code or Description since they're mapped to 'Rice'.

Handling missingness: Since the data from 2020-21 onwards is complete, maybe forward-fill or drop earlier years with missing data. Validation would use time-series split to avoid future leakage. Expected outputs would be a regression model's metrics and visualizations showing the relationship between production and exports.

Need to make sure all columns in the required files meet the 65% completeness. The export data's 2020-21 to 2024-25 has 8 rows, which is 100% non-null for those years. The production data's columns for those years also have no nulls. So, the required files are valid. Excluding the USD columns and redundant keys is necessary for the model.
