        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user wanted to run task TSK-003, which is \"Classify High-Yield Crops\". But when I checked the pipeline status, it mentioned PLAN-TSK-002, and the execution results for that plan show a naive prediction with high MAPE and negative R2. That doesn't look good.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm if there's a mix-up between the task ID and the plan ID. The user asked for TSK-003, but the system is referencing PLAN-TSK-002. Maybe there's an error in the task-plan mapping. Alternatively, perhaps TSK-003 is associated with PLAN-TSK-002, but the results are from a different task.\n\nLooking at the metrics, the MAPE is extremely high (19664.55%), which suggests the model isn't performing well. The R2 is negative, indicating that the model is worse than a horizontal line. This might be a naive baseline model, as mentioned in the summary. The user probably expects better results, so I should check if the correct plan was executed for TSK-003.\n\nI should also check if there are any visualizations available for PLAN-TSK-002 to understand where the model is failing. Maybe the data isn't suitable for the task, or the features aren't properly selected. The user might need to revisit the data preparation or model selection steps.\n\nAdditionally, since the task is a classification problem (identifying high-yield crops), the metrics provided (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R2) are regression metrics. That's a red flag. Classification tasks should use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. This suggests that there might be a mismatch between the task type and the evaluation metrics used. The user needs to be informed about this discrepancy and advised to check the model's configuration.\n\nIn summary, the key issues are:\n1. Possible task-plan ID mismatch.\n2. Poor model performance indicated by high error metrics.\n3. Incorrect metrics for a classification task.\n4. Need to review data and model setup for TSK-003.\n\nI should present these findings to the user and suggest next steps like verifying the task-plan association, checking the model type and metrics, and possibly re-running with appropriate configurations.\n</think>\n\nHere are the key findings from the execution:\n\n**Model Performance:**\n- High error metrics (MAE: 171.68, RMSE: 313.30)\n- Extremely high MAPE (19,664.55%) indicating poor predictive accuracy\n- Negative R² score (-0.13) suggesting model performs worse than a horizontal line baseline\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **Metric Mismatch:** These regression metrics (MAE/RMSE) don't align with the classification task goal (identifying high-yield crops)\n2. **Naive Baseline:** The \"fallback execution\" suggests the system defaulted to a naive prediction method\n3. **Data Issues:** The negative R² indicates potential problems with feature selection or data scaling\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Show the visualizations for this execution?\n2. Propose improvements to the task configuration?\n3. Try re-running with different parameters?",
