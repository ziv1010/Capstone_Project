PLOT 2: Residual Plot: Predicted vs Residuals
================================================================================

What it shows:
Scatter plot showing residuals (actual-predicted) against predicted values for Area-2024-25

Given data (from original dataset):
Area-2024-25 column (actual values from the dataset)

Predicted data (from model output):
predicted_Area-2024-25 column (output from Linear Regression model)

Key insights:
Residuals appear randomly distributed around zero with no clear pattern, suggesting model assumptions are generally met. The color gradient shows residual magnitude, with most errors within ±50 units.
