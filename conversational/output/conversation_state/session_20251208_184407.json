I should check if the task was ever created or executed. If the user created a custom task earlier, perhaps the ID was different. Alternatively, maybe the pipeline hasn't been run for that task yet. I need to guide the user to verify the plan ID or check the pipeline status to see if the task is in progress or needs to be executed first. Let me suggest checking the available tasks and the pipeline status to troubleshoot.\n</think>\n\nIt seems there are no results available for plan-tsk-5315. Let's troubleshoot:\n\n1. **Check if task exists**: First verify if this task was actually created\n2. **Check pipeline status**: See if the task is in progress or needs execution\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Show all available tasks?\n2. Check the current pipeline status?\n3. Try running a different task instead?",

Then they tried plan-tsk-5135, which also wasn't found. Maybe they're using the wrong IDs or there are no results yet.\n\nI should check if these plans were ever created. If the user hasn't created a task yet, there won't be any results. So, maybe they need to create a new task first. Let me offer to show available tasks or create a new one based on their query.\n\nAlso, maybe the pipeline hasn't been run for these tasks. If the task exists but hasn't been executed, the results wouldn't be there. But if the task doesn't exist at all, then running it isn't possible. I should ask if they want to create a new task or check existing ones. That way, I can guide them to the right next step.\n</think>\n\nIt seems plan-tsk-5135 also doesn't exist in the results. Let's clarify:\n\n1. **No results** means either:\n   - The task was never created\n   - The task was created but not executed yet\n   - The task ID contains a typo\n\nWould you like to:\n1. See all available task proposals? (`get_task_proposals`)\n2. Create a new forecasting task from scratch?\n3. Check the pipeline status to see what's ready?\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!",
