I need to confirm that they want to execute this specific task. Let me check the pipeline stages that will be involved. The stages are 3 → 3B → 3.5A → 3.5B → 4 → 5. I should explain each stage briefly so the user knows what to expect. Also, I need to set the pipeline action to \"run_pipeline\" with the task ID. Make sure to mention that the results and visualizations will be available after execution. Keep the response clear and concise.\n</think>\n\nI'll execute your task (TSK-5135) for predicting bajra cultivation area in kharif season. The pipeline will run these stages:\n\n1. **Stage 3**: Data preparation & feature engineering\n2. **Stage 3B**: Model selection & training\n3. **Stage 3.5A**: Validation\n4. **Stage 3.5B**: Testing\n5. **Stage 4**: Forecast generation\n6. **Stage 5**: Result compilation\n\nPipeline action set to: `run_pipeline` for task TSK-5135  \nThis will generate predictions for 3 future years with error metrics and visualizations.",

Let me check the previous steps to make sure everything's set.\n\nFirst, the user's query was evaluated, and the best dataset was selected: All-India-profile_-Crop-wise-Area.csv. The target column is Area-2021-22. The task was created with a 3-year horizon. \n\nNow, when the user says \"run tsk-5135\", I need to trigger the pipeline. The system should execute stages 3 to 5. Let me confirm the pipeline action is set to run_pipeline with the task ID. \n\nI should respond by confirming the execution and outlining the stages. Also, mention that results and visualizations will be available after completion. Keep it clear and concise.\n</think>\n\nPipeline action set to: `run_pipeline` for task **TSK-5135**  \nExecuting stages: 3 → 3B → 3.5A → 3.5B → 4 → 5  \n\nThis will:  \n- Prepare data for bajra kharif season area prediction  \n- Train forecasting models  \n- Validate predictions  \n- Generate 3-year forecasts  \n- Create visualizations and metrics  \n\nResults will be available at completion. Would you like to monitor progress or check status?",
